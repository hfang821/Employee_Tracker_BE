# Employee_Tracker_BE
Inquirer &amp; SQL queries Backend

## Description:

* This program is designed to build a employee database using mysql && the functionality of modifying the database in the terminal window using inquirer.js.
* This project was completed based on the Node.js, inquirer.js and mysql database, and can be run once installed.
* I have learned the ways to work at the server-side of javaScript database development, so that the front-end can retrieve the data by a set of query statements.

## Built By:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* npm (inquirer.js)
* npm (mysql2)
